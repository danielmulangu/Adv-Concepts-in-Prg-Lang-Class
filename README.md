This contains all the material that i deemed necessary for my Advanced Concepts in Programming Language Class taken at UNO.
It will also contain my homeworks solutions, exercises and lp files on here.
Note: In this class, we used python and ASP as programming languages.
The materials include exercises, given in the class as well as all the necessary notes and lectures notes that i used in the class as well as all the quizzes and solution and projects.

-------------------------------
Note: Will also add the class's projects to the repository for archiving purpose.

The first project is the generalized sudoku. Simply put, i was trying to solve a sudoku using Answer Set Programming. Initially, we are trying to solve a simple sudoku (a 2x2 if i remember correctly). Then, get a little more complex by solving a 3x3, then go a step further by solving a generalized version (ergo a nxn sudoku).

Note to self: Talk about the different projects in more details and emphasize how it helped me understand the course better

Project #1: Sudoku
